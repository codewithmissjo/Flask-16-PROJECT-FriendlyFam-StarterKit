### Phases

Phase 1: Setup and Starter Code

Phase 2: Home Route and Database Connection

Phase 3: User Authentication and Registration

Phase 4: Events Features (Add and View)

Phase 5: Event Features (Edit and Cancel)

Phase 6: Hosting and Deploying the Application

### Concepts and Requirements:

● User Authentication (login and signup functionalities)

● Session (remembering users and keeping them logged in until they logout)

● Database interaction and management (storing, retrieving, and presenting information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and posts)

● Deploying a database-backed web application

### Description:

The starter version is to be improved by adding the server side functionalities, such as: routes to different pages, handling form submissions and authenticating form data, handle logins and registrations, setting sessions, handling logouts, interacting with the database to store new users and new event posts, and keeping the home page events updated (those still on and the ones that have been canceled)
